You will need the resource folder to be able to play the game once compiled on your environment. You can download the resource files from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bjyriudxq1omt8s/Picking%20Sticks%20Files.zip?dl=0) or you can make your own and retweet @ricanteja so I can see your funny sprites :-)
